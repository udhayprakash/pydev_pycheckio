Purpose: https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/verify-anagrams/solve/

An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a 
word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters 
exactly once. Two words are anagrams to each other if we can get one from another 
by rearranging the letters. Anagrams are case-insensitive and don't take account 
whitespaces.
