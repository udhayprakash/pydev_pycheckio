"So, the Labyrinth is a piece of cake, is it? Well, let's see how you deal with this little slice..."

Sarah: "You don't by any chance know the way through this labyrinth, do you?"
The Worm: "Who, me? No, I'm just a worm. Say, come inside, and meet the missus"

"Labyrinth" (1986)

The labyrinth has no walls, but bushes surround the path on each side. If a players move into a bush, they lose. The labyrinth is presented as a matrix (a list of lists): 1 is a bush and 0 is part of the path. The labyrinth's size is 12 x 12 and the outer cells are also bushes. Players start at cell (1,1)....
