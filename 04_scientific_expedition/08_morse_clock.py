Help Stephen to create a module for converting a normal time string to a morse time string. As you can see in the illustration, a gray circle means on, while a white circle means off. Every digit in the time string contains a different number of slots. The first digit for the hours has a length of 2 while the second digit for the hour has a length of 4. The first digits for the minutes and seconds have a length of 3 while the second digits for the minutes and seconds have a length of 4. Every digit in the time is converted to binary representation. You will convert every on (or 1) signal to dash ("-") and every off (or 0) signal to dot (".").

An time string could be in the follow formats: "hh:mm:ss", "h:m:s" or "hh:m:ss". The "missing" digits are zeroes. For example, "1:2:3" is the same as "01:02:03".

The result will be a morse time string with specific format:
"h h : m m : s s"
where each digits represented as sequence of "." and "-"

Input: A normal time string as a string (unicode).

Output: The morse time string as a string.

Precondition:
time_string contains correct time.
