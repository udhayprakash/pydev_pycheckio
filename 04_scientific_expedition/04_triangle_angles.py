Purpose: https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/triangle-angles/solve

You are given the lengths for each side on a triangle. You need to find all three angles for this triangle. If the given side lengths cannot form a triangle (or form a degenerated triangle), then you must return all angles as 0 (zero). .... Each angle is measured in degrees and rounded to the nearest integer number (Standard mathematical rounding).
